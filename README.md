# Comparative-analysis-of-different-types-of-multipliers-for-effective-power-and-time
The main objective of this proposed concept to design an efficient and enhanced multiplier .In this the multipliers radix 8 modified booth multiplier is used for low density and latency and also reduction of more partial products in order to optimize particular area constraints and Wallace tree multiplier is for high speed operation. The design is implemented using verilog hdl and it is also implemented on hardware using zed board.
